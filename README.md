#  🎲 Tenzies Game

> A fun and interactive dice-rolling game where you try to get all dice to match. Test your luck and strategy!

---

## 🪞 Overview  
Tenzies is a simple yet addictive game built with React. The player rolls 10 dice and chooses which ones to “hold” in order to match all values. The game continues until all dice show the same number — then 🎉 Confetti appears to celebrate the win!
This project is perfect for beginners learning React state management, component props, and conditional rendering.
